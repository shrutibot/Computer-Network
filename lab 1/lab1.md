# Lab 1: Ethernet Cable Creation and Testing

## Procedure

### A. Straight-Through Ethernet Cable

- Measure and cut the Ethernet cable to the required length.
- Remove approximately one inch of the outer insulation from both ends of the cable.
- Separate and straighten the wire pairs.
- Arrange the wires according to the **T568B standard**:

  2. Orange
  3. White-Green
  4. Blue
  5. White-Blue
  6. Green
  7. White-Brown
  8. Brown
- Trim all the wires evenly so they align properly.
- Insert the wires fully into the RJ45 connector while maintaining the correct order.
- Use a crimping tool to firmly attach the connector.
- Repeat the same process on the other end using the same wiring sequence.
- Verify the cable using a cable tester.

### B. Crossover Ethernet Cable

- Cut the Ethernet cable to the required length and strip the outer insulation from both ends.
- Arrange one end of the cable using the **T568A standard**:
  1. White-Green
  2. Green
  3. White-Orange
  4. Blue
  5. White-Blue
  6. Orange
  7. White-Brown

  1. White-Orange
  2. Orange
  3. White-Green
  4. Blue
  5. White-Blue
  6. Green
  7. White-Brown
  8. Brown
- Trim the wires evenly before insertion.
- Insert the wires carefully into the RJ45 connectors.
- Crimp both ends securely using a crimping tool.
- Test the cable using a cable tester.
